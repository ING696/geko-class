        <h2>Oure Nature</h2>
        <p>
          Nature is the quiet balance between life, air, water, and earth. It
          surrounds us with mountains, rivers, forests, and endless skies. Every
          season brings its own colors and moods, from blooming spring to snowy
          winter. Nature teaches patience through the slow growth of trees and
          the steady flow of rivers. It provides the food we eat and the oxygen
          we breathe. When we spend time in nature, we often feel calmer and
          more connected. However, it needs our care and respect to remain
          healthy. Protecting nature means protecting our own future.
